# Introduction
The Arts and Crafts Hub is an online platform designed to unite artists, crafters, and enthusiasts.
It serves as a showcase for creative works, a networking space for like-minded individuals, and a marketplace for handcrafted goods. 
Whether you're an artist, buyer, or art enthusiast, this platform has something for everyone.

# Project Objectives
Provide a centralized platform for showcasing art and craftwork.
Address the lack of exposure faced by creatives in the arts and crafts community.
